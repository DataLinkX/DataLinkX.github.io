desp: Boning Zhang received her PhD from Purdue University in 2019, working on targeted drug delivery to Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells for improved control and efficacy. She is now a Postdoctoral Fellow in Shirley Liuâ€™s lab at Harvard University and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Her current interests include combining high-throughput experimental perturbations and computational analysis to understand the epigenetic modulation of immune cells, especially how small molecule modulators for nuclear receptors and chromatin remodelers may contribute to the tumor microenvironment.
