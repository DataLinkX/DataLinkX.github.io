desp: Qin joined the group in 2017 under co-mentorship of Dr. Myles Brown and Dr. Shirley Liu to study the intricacies of glucocorticoid signaling its impact on the tumor-immune microenvironment, as well as to utilize CRISPR-mediated gene editing to uncover genetic vulnerabilities in glucocorticoid-refractory pediatric leukemia. In her previous academic career as an (almost) cancer researcher, she trained with David Langenau at Massachusetts General Hospital to develop immune compromised zebrafish models that allow human and mouse cell transplantation. Qin received her Ph.D. in Human Biology and Translational Medicine from Harvard University in 2017, and B.S. in Biological Sciences from Nanjing University in 2012.â€¯
