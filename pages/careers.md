### [Associate Computational Biologist in translational cancer research](https://careers-dfci.icims.com/jobs/18700/associate-computational-biologist%2c-liu-lab/job?mobile=false&width=986&height=500&bga=true&needsRedirect=false&jan1offset=-300&jun1offset=-240)
The Shirley Liu Lab is recruiting a data scientist to develop machine learning algorithms and pipelines, build databases and interactive web servers, and conduct high-throughput data analyses and integration to model tumor immunology and understand cancer patient response to immunotherapy. We recently received funding for a Cancer Moonshot Project by the National Cancer Institute to build a Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC). NCI plans to conduct comprehensive profiling of clinical samples from immuno-oncology trials. The data scientist will work on various computational aspects of immune-profiling algorithms and analyses, with the goal of identifying biomarkers for optimizing immunotherapy strategies in cancer.

### Computational biology postdoc position at the Liu Lab
Ideal applicant should have: <br>
1. A PhD degree in related field (bioinformatics, physics, statistics, engineering, etc) received in the last 3 years
2. Strong quantitative background (machine learning, Bayesian inference, etc.) or computational genomics experiences (high-throughput sequence analysis, etc.)
3. Strong programming skills: ((Python or C or C++ or Java) & R)
4. At least two first-authored English papers (or three if co-first authors) with submitted, accepted or published status in journals
5. Good spoken and written communication skills in English. 
Interested applicants should submit CV, a letter of interest with a one-page proposal for a project to be conducted in the Liu Lab, and contact information for three references to [Shirley Liu](mailto:xsliu@ds.dfci.harvard.edu) with subject line “Computational postdoctoral application”.

### Experimental biology position position at the Liu Lab
We are recruiting experimental postdoctoral fellows under the joint supervision of X. Shirley Liu and Myles Brown at the Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The postdoc fellow will adopt / develop cutting edge genomic technologies (e.g. CRISPR screens, scRNA-seq / scATAC-seq) to understand tumor gene regulation, identify novel tumor immune regulators, and develop tumor drug respnose / resistance biomarkers. 
Ideal applicant should have: 
1.	PhD graduation in biology-related field. 
2.	Motivation, independence, and creativity.
3.	Strong molecular, cell biology and genomics skills. 
4.	At least two first-authored English papers (or three if co-first authors) with submitted, accepted or published status in journals
5.	Good spoken and written communication skills in English.
6.	Computational biology and quantitative skills are a plus!
Interested applicants should submit CV, a letter of interest with a one-page proposal for a project to be conducted in the Liu Lab, and contact information for three references to [Shirley Liu](mailto:xsliu@ds.dfci.harvard.edu) with subject line “Experimental postdoctoral application”.
