## Basic Knowledge for Bioinformatics Research

### Sequencing Technologies and Their Aims
    - Chip-seq: Finding the regions in DNA where a Protein (e.g., TF) binds on
    - RNA-seq: Transcriptome Data including sRNA (e.g., miroRNA, siRNA, PiRNA), miRNAs
    - Genome Exon Sequencing
    - chiRq-seq 
    - RIP-seq
    - ATAC-seq: measuring openess of chramatin, the peraks are locations where TFs are bind on
