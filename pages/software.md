# Software
### Single Cell 
- [**MAESTRO**](http://github.com/liulab-dfci/MAESTRO) &nbsp;
Model-based Analyses of Transcriptome and Regulome (MAESTRO) is a comprehensive open-source computational workflow for integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data from multiple platforms.
- [**TISCH**](http://tisch.comp-genomics.org/home/)  &nbsp; 
Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) provides detailed cell-type annotation for all curated tumor scRNA-seq datasets, enabling users to explore tumor immunity across many tumor scRNA-seq cohorts.

### Transcriptome Analysis
- [**GFold**](https://bitbucket.org/feeldead/gfold) &nbsp;
Generalized fold change for ranking differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data.
- [**SAGE-seq gene EXPRESSion analysis pipelines (sageExpress)**](/resources/software/sageExpress.zip) &nbsp;
Gene expression analysis pipelines for SAGE-Seq including tag mapping, novel normalization method using empirical Bayes and differential gene analysis.
