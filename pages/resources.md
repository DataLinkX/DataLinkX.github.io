### Resources
- [How to read a paper?](/resources/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) (Important!)
- What is a PhD ? [see Illustration](/resources/PhD/IllustratedGuidePhD-Matt-Might.pdf)
- [Basics for Bioinformatics](/bioinfo)
- [Research Notes](/Renotes)
- [Useful Datasets](/datasets)
- eBooks: [Electronic library](http://libgen.rs/), [Springer Link](http://link.springer.com/?)

### Requirements on Good Research
- **Read papers as many as you can** from high-quality journals or research groups (see below)
- **Think bigger but verified with cautious**
- **Data Science** emphasizing on **Findings from data**: convince the domain researchers that the proposed method (statistical model or computational method) is widely applicable to have new findings. 
- **Statistical methodology** emphasizing on **Statistical Inference**: convince statistical researchers that the statistical method is accurate in terms of some statistical properties such as consistency.
    - New insights/methodology into classical problems with essential difference (more efficient, faster, powerful, applicable); 
    - New connections between different methods/problems; 
    - New theory for methodologies to understand the good performance of the method; 
    - Extending old methods to new settings (not recommend in general);
